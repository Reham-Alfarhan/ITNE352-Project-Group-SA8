# Flight arrival Client/Server Information System 

## Project Description:
This project develops a client-server system that facilitates the exchange of flight data for a specified airport via an external API.  The system is designed to demonstrate client/server architecture, network connection, multithreading, and the use of coding techniques. Users can interact with the application through the graphical user interface (GUI) of the tool.

## • Requirements:
Installing the necessary libraries in your environment is necessary to guarantee error-free code execution. Enter the following commands into your terminal to accomplish this:  requests to install pip for tkinter pip  How to run the code:


## • Running the code:
Split the terminal in half after opening it in your IDE. ii. Open a terminal and run the server file, python.\server-side.py.  III. Launch the GUI_Client.py Python client file in the other.

## • Interacting with the GUI:
Once the client code has connected to the server, the user will be asked for their name.  o A menu with the following choices will be shown to the user: Quit, sources, and headlines.  If you select "Quit," the connection will be terminated.  o A list of headlines and sources with a synopsis of each result will be generated after the user selects an option. The user can select a result to see more details about it if he needs them.
