# Multithreaded Flight arrival Client/Server Information System 

### Project Description:
This project develops a client-server system that facilitates the exchange of flight data for a specified airport via an external API.  The system is designed to demonstrate client/server architecture, network connection, multithreading, and the use of coding techniques. Users can interact with the application through the graphical user interface (GUI) of the tool.
